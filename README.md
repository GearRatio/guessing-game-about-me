# Guessing game and bio for Code Fellows Lab 201

## Guessing Game

Before the page loads a prompt asks the user to input their name. A greeting message is displayed and the user is asked to respond with a yes or not to take a quiz.

- If the user enters "yes" an alert pops up telling the user to get ready for the quiz.
- If the user enters "no" an alert pops up telling the user they have no choice.
- If the user cancels, the prompt goes away and my biography page is displayed.
  - Once the user responds with "yes" or "no", a series of 5 questions is asked.
  - After each user "guess" an alert tells the user if the response is correct or not.
- The user must guess a number between 1 and 10.
- The user is prompted a question about my favorite fish to catch.
  - 6 attempts are allowed
  - If user is unable to guess the answer an alert provides all answers to the user.
- Once all questions have been answered an alert thanks the user, by name, for playing the game and a total number of correct responses is display to the user.
- At the end of the game my biography page displays.

## Added Top Ten Places to Visit

A quick list of top ten places you should visit that I highly recommend.

## Lab 04 Paired Programming

I was the driver and Jared was the navigator. During our session I helped Jared refactor if/else blocks into functions to reduce redundency. We increased readability in the code and it was a lot of fun!
